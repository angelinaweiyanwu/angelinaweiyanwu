              <p>
                WE died, 
                both YOU and I have returned to the sea.
                I was initially happy to have found you,
                but I am now even more grateful for your departure.
                There are countless fish in the sea, 
                and we did not belong to each other. 
                We have reached a point where we must part ways 
                and embark on separate paths.On these individual journeys, 
                we will grow and eventually find our soulmates.
                <br>
                This marks our farewell.
